A Java API to the Proteomics Standards Initiative's mzIdentML format (version 1.1 - PSI stable version).

The mzIdentML data standard captures peptide and protein identification data, generated from mass spectrometry. 
For more information about mzIdentML.

The API can be imported directly as a jar file to provide access to read and write functionality for mzIdentML. 
The API builds on top of JaxB capabilities, by providing an indexing scheme that allows random access to parts of the file. 
Under the wiki there are some code snippets showing example usage.

The API is used as part of parsers for converting X!Tandem's XML file output and Omssa's OMX (XML) output 
to mzIdentML, accessible from: http://code.google.com/p/mzidentml-parsers/.

Using jMzIdentML Under Downloads - http://code.google.com/p/jmzidentml/downloads/list there is a zip file
containing the main jar that can be imported directly into software.
